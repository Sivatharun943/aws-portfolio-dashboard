Hiring Manager  
Trianz  
New Jersey  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I just finished my Master's in Computer Science and I'm really interested in joining your team at Trianz. I've been working with AWS and cloud technologies for a while now, and when I saw what you guys are doing with digital transformation, it got me excited about the possibility of working there.

During my time at Capgemini Engineering, I spent about 2.5 years working on embedded systems and testing automation. It wasn't cloud work, but I got really good at automating things and working with complex systems. That experience taught me how to break down problems and build reliable solutions - skills I think translate well to cloud architecture.

After that, I dove deep into AWS. I've worked through tons of hands-on labs - everything from setting up S3 websites to building serverless applications with Lambda and API Gateway. I also got my AWS certifications in Cloud Foundations, Development, and Architecture. But honestly, the real learning happened when I was actually building things and figuring out how all the pieces fit together.

Some projects I'm particularly proud of:
- Built a blue-green deployment setup that let me update applications without any downtime
- Set up centralized logging using Lambda and OpenSearch so you can actually find what went wrong when things break
- Created a few serverless APIs that scale automatically and don't cost much to run
- Even got into some ML stuff with SageMaker, which was pretty cool

What I like about Trianz is that you're not just doing basic cloud migrations - you're helping companies completely rethink how they operate. That's the kind of work I want to be doing. I want to help businesses solve real problems, not just move their servers to the cloud.

I know I'm still early in my career, but I learn fast and I'm not afraid to dig into complex problems. At Capgemini, I worked with senior architects and learned how to ask the right questions and deliver what clients actually need. I think that experience, combined with my AWS skills, would let me contribute to your team pretty quickly.

I'm ready to relocate to New Jersey and I'm genuinely excited about the possibility of growing my career at Trianz. From what I've read, you invest in developing your people, and that's exactly the kind of environment where I think I'd thrive.

Would love to chat more about how I could help your team. Thanks for taking the time to consider my application.

Best regards,  
Sivatharun Devireddy
